# This is the App which interacts with user.It manages payments according to the time they have parked.
# CUrrent rate for parking (just for testing) - $1 for 1 sec
# Also we are assuming that all sized cars cost the same

# The App also tracks user/driver with their initial park timing so that they can be charged when they leave
